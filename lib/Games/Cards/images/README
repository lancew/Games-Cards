This directory contains card images created by Oliver Xymoron
(oxymoron@waste.org) which are available at:
http://www.waste.org/~oxymoron/cards

I didn't include the "source code" (PNM files and perl scripts to create
cards) because it would double the size of the Games::Cards distribution.
It's all available at the above-mentioned site, however.

As far as license, Oliver told me in an email that he was willing to
release it either under the GPL or the Artistic license. Which is cool,
since Games::Cards has the same terms.
