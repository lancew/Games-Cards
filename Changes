Significant changes for Perl extension Games::Cards.

1.36 2000/01/24  (Millenium version :)
	- Bug in test.pl (thanks cpan-testers!)

1.35 1999/11/10
	- Added minimal test in test.pl
	- Added GC::CardSet::clone and GC::Card::clone. This allows "restart"
	  in card games
	- Andy Bach and Michael Houghton both sent me implementations of the 
	  solitaire game "Freecell" within a couple days of each other.
