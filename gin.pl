  $0 - play gin

  - On each turn, each player picks a card, then discards.

  - A "meld" is 3 or 4 cards of the same rank, or a consecutive runs of 
    three or four cards of the same suit. You win when you have three melds
    (two melds of 3 and one of 4). You have to "say gin" to win.

  - Commands are made up of letters, card descriptions, or numbers (from 1 to
    $Cards_Per_Hand). Commands/card names are case insensitive

    Pick:
    s       	Take the top card from the stock (deck)
    d       	Take the top card from the discard pile

    Discard:
    8D      	Discard the eight of diamonds
    8D g[in] 	Discard eight of diamonds and say "I have gin!"
                (The program will complain if you don't actually have gin.)

    At any time:
    8D 2    	Put the 8 of diamonds at position 2 in your hand
    so[rt]  	Sort cards in your hand by value (not suit)
    q       	quits a game, either starting a new round or quitting entirely
    h       	prints this help message
