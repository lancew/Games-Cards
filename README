		    README for Games::Cards module
		    ------------------------------

Games::Cards is a Perl module used to write card games. It's basically
a bunch of object-oriented methods to create sets of cards and move cards
within and between those sets---which, if you think about it, is all that a
card game is.

See the embedded pod documentation (e.g., "perldoc Games::Cards"). The docs
describe only the public subroutines and classes (plus a couple private classes
whose subroutines are inherited by public derived classes). There is some more
documentation (on private stuff) as regular comments in the module.

And that's not all! The module comes with some (free!) games that have been
written using Games::Cards. These include:

klondike.pl - Otherwise known as regular old Solitaire. Currently the most
        useful of these games.

war.pl - This game plays both sides in a game of War, saving time and effort
	for weary users. And in case you saw the movie Wargames, don't worry:
	Even though the module may be buggy, it probably won't lead to a
	global thermonuclear war.

gin.pl - Plays gin. Unfortunately, Games::Cards doesn't yet work over a network
        so both players play on the same screen, which kind of ruins the
	game. However, support for Server/Client games is under active
	development.

Version info:

WARNING! THIS CODE IS STILL ALPHA
The whole package may change radically before it becomes beta.

I'm developing the module with RCS, and the version number is derived
from that. Right now I'm using v1.*, and the version numbers are changing
quickly. When things settle down, I'll move to v2.* and use subversions
so that the version numbers change more slowly.

Installation
------------

This module uses MakeMaker, so to install it, just do:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make install
