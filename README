		    README for Games::Cards package
		    -------------------------------

Games::Cards is a Perl module used to write card games. It's basically
a bunch of object-oriented methods to create sets of cards and move cards
between those sets---which, if you think about it, is all that a card game is.

See the embedded pod documentation to see what it can do.

And that's not all! The module comes with some (free!) games that have been
written using Games::Cards.

WARNING! This code is still alpha, and the whole package may change radically
before it becomes beta.

Installation
------------

This module uses MakeMaker, so to install it, just do:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make install
