		    README for Games::Cards module
		    ------------------------------

Games::Cards is a Perl module used to write card games. It's basically
a bunch of object-oriented methods to create sets of cards and move cards
within and between those sets---which, if you think about it, is all that a
card game is.

Games::Cards::Tk allows you to write games with a GUI, using card images
created by Oliver Xymoron (see http://www.waste.org/~oxymoron/cards) and
released under the GPL/Artistic License (Thanks, Oliver!).

See the embedded pod documentation for more info, including known bugs.
See Changes for recent changes in the module.
See TODO for future plans.

Games
-----

The module comes with some (free!) games in the script/ directory:

klondike.tk - Otherwise known as regular old Solitaire. 

freecell.tk - The popular Freecell variant of solitaire.

war.pl - This game plays both sides in a game of War, saving time and effort
	for weary users. And in case you saw the movie Wargames, don't worry:
	Even though the module may be buggy, it probably won't lead to a
	global thermonuclear war.

gin.pl - Plays gin. Unfortunately, Games::Cards doesn't yet work over a network
        so both players play on the same screen, which kind of ruins the
	game. Support for Server/Client games is under development
	(your help would be appreciated!)

---------------------------------------------------------------
WARNING! THIS CODE IS STILL ALPHA
The whole package may change radically before it becomes beta.
Games::Cards::Tk is even more alpha than the rest.

Installation
------------

This module uses MakeMaker, so to install it, just do:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install


--------------------------------------------------
Note:

I suspect that many Games::Cards games will be solitaire, especially before
networked game playing works. For general solitaire info, try
http://www.solitairecentral.com or.  For rules to several gazillion (320)
solitaire games, try http://www.goodsol.com/pgshelp/how_to_play.htm, which are
the help pages for the shareware "Pretty Good Solitaire" distribution.
